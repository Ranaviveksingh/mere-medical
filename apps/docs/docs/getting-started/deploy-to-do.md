To deploy Mari Medical to Digital Ocean App Platform, click the button below and follow the steps:

[![Deploy to DO](https://www.deploytodo.com/do-btn-blue.svg)](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps/new?repo=https://github.com/cfu288/mari-medical/tree/main)

To set up OnPatient integration, you'll need to provide the values for the environmental variables `ONPATIENT_CLIENT_ID` and `ONPATIENT_CLIENT_SECRET`. Go to [this guide](./onpatient-setup) to see how to get those values. If you don't need OnPatient integration, feel free to leave those variables blank.
