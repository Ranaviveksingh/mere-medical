# Supported Patient Portals

Currently, only the following patient portals are supported:

- MyChart/Epic
- Cerner Health
- Allscripts Connect
- DrChrono/OnPatient

Support for more patient portals is coming soon.

Mere Medical is still in active development. If you run into any issues when connecting using a supported portal, [please submit a bug report](mailto:cfu288@meremedical.co).
