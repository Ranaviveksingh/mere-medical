# What is Mari Medical?

Suppose someone were to ask you to collect all of your medical records starting now from every doctor or hospital you've been to. How long would it take you to get a copy of all of your medical records in one place and digitized? For most people, it takes a long time. You'd need to log in to your different patient portals, find paper copies of older records that still need to be digitized, and collect old immunization records and cards. Maybe you also have some medical imaging stored on CD's or USB drives. Its surprisingly hard to get all of your records digitalized and in one place without a lot of manual curation.

Many hospitals have patient portals, which is a step in the right direction. But most hospitals have different portals - each with different logins. Some private companies promise to make this easier by collecting and managing your medical records for you - but can you trust them?

Mari Medical tries to provide a solution to this complex problem. Mari Medical is a self-hosted web application that allows you to connect all of your medical records in one place by syncing to all your patient portals and curating your records.

Here are our goals:

- Free: Mari Medical will always be free to download and self-host. Everyone should have easy access to their medical records.
- Built on open standards: Conforming to open standards like HL7 FHIR will enable interoperability between multiple healthcare systems.
- Open Source: You shouldn't need to take us for our word. Our source is available so you can review each line of code that is going to be touching your medical records.
- Self-Hostable: You can run this software on your local computer or your own servers. No need to rely on third-party services.
- Offline-First: While some features need online connectivity, the web app will always function offline so you can access your records - even if you can't access the internet.
- Multi-device syncing support - Medical records are useless if they're stuck on your computer but you only have your phone on you.

Mari Medical is still in the early stages of its development and is still rough around the edges. It currently requires someone with a technical background to get it up and running - you should be familiar with docker. The hope is that by keeping this open source, others can help host, so eventually, non-technical users can use this software without setup.

## Getting Started

As Mari Medical is still being developed, so is this documentation. Complete documentation is coming soon!

### What you'll need

- Docker
