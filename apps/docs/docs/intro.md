# What is Mari Medical?

How long would it take you to collect _all_ of your medical records from every doctor or hospital you've been to? For most people, it would take a long time. You'd need to log in to various patient portals, find paper copies of older records that still need to be digitized, and collect old immunization records. Maybe you also have some medical imaging stored on CDs or USB drives. It's surprisingly hard to get all your records digitalized and in one place without a lot of manual curation.

Many hospitals have online patient portals, which is a helpful first step in making your records easy to access. Still, different health systems have different portals - each with different logins. On the other hand, some private companies attempt to make this task easier by collecting and managing your medical records for you - but can you trust them?

Mari Medical tries to provide a solution to this complex problem. Mari Medical is a self-hosted web application that allows you to collect all your medical records in one place. It handles collecting and curating your records, so you don't have to.

Here are our goals:

- **Free**: Mari Medical will always be free to download and self-host. Everyone should have easy access to their medical records.
- **Built on open standards**: Conforming to open standards like HL7 FHIR will enable interoperability between multiple healthcare systems.
- **Open Source**: You shouldn't need to take us for our word. Our source is available so you can review each line of code that is going to be touching your medical records.
- **Self-Hostable**: You can run this software on your local computer or your own servers. No need to rely on third-party services.
- **Offline-First**: While some features need online connectivity, the web app will always function offline so you can access your records - even if you can't access the internet.
- **Multi-device syncing support**: Medical records are useless if they're stuck on your computer but you only have your phone on you.

Mari Medical is still in the early stages of its development. Lots of features are still rough around the edges. Using Mari Medical currently requires someone with a technical background to get it up and running - you should be familiar with docker. The hope is that by keeping this open source, others can run this software so others can use it without setup.
